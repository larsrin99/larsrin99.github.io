I have used the Jupyter Notebook supplied from the git: https://github.com/lovellbrian/fingerprint/tree/main/SimpleFingerprintRecognitionExample

I implemented a new .py file to manage the functions for processing the fingerprints.
Now comes the complicated part...

To create a storage system, I am trying to use the pickle library to store fingerprints as binary data.
