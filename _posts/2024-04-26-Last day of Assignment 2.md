I thought I would be able to do the whole assignment.
Unfortunately I only had a week to use on this task and only managed do to maybe half.

### Tasks:

| Q1        | Q2           | Q3 & Q4  |  Q5 |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:| -----:|
| ✅-       | ✅  | X |    ✅  |

In Q1 I succesfully made a reasonable GUI, but the evaluation seemed to bring me a lot of new errors in loading files from pickle.
Since my system was built around this storage system it was too time consuming to change it.
Otherwise my database works for enroll and compare.

For Q2 I followed Jeremy Howards guide to set up GitHub blogs, which turned out quite good.
I have some formatting to go through and maybe give it a little glowup!

Q3 and Q4 was unsuccessful. I run a Macbook pro with an M1 chip. So when trying to follow guidelines to set up devcontainers and cpu/gpu, there was way too many obstacles in the way.
I used in total 25 hours to try to set this up, and I am still not sure if I am able to do this course on my Mac at all. 
I regret not starting earlier on this project but I have several larger projects in other courses so it is hard to prioritize. 

Q5 seemed like a very fun task. The Nobel Prize experiment was extremely cool to learn about.
I ran the notebook at IBM's website and took notes about what made this experiment so special.

Hopefully the tutors and Brian understand my frustration in Q3 and Q4, but otherwise it was fun.
